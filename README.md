# fretboard-notes

A simple trainer to help learning notes on a guitar fretboard.  It is inspired by an excercise sheet from Steve Vai's Vaideology book - this app just shows the note and string you need to find, click screen to access the next note.  Note / string combinations are randomised before the excercise starts.

Extra functionality is added by ability to filter strings and accidentals to target specific weakspots.

Background colour changes red for each note after a set time to add challenge.
